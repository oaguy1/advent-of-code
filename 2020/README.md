# 2020

 The 2020 Advent of Code can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Each of my solutions this year can be invoked the same way:

 ```bash
python3 /path/to/solution.py /path/to/input
 ```

Each solution is named for its day in the calendar. There are several test inputs usually included as well. Some solutions may have additional, optional command line arguments (see [day 9](./day09/)).
